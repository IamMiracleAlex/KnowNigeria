                        Any visit to the city of Abeokuta would be incomplete without stopping by at the “fortress of Abeokuta”; Olumo Rock. No surprise that this rock is located in Abeokuta, as the name “Abeokuta” itself means “under the rock” as has been one of the choice tourist attractions in Nigeria. Olumo Rock has long served as a rock of offence and a fortress for the people of Egba Land, since the 19th century.  At Olumo Rock, you would be treated to attractions like natural tunnels, unusual trees, natural cantilevers, gardens on the rock, broken pathways, monuments of the belief system of the rock’s primeval settlers, e.t.c. You don’t want to miss these attractions, do you?

                        The Rock ranks high as one of the choice tourist attractions in the Country. Zuma Rock, the monolithic Inselberg with a human face, is located in Madalla, Niger State, to the North of Abuja. It was once described as the unquestionable watchman of the F.C.T. It is the sandy concealment that hangs like a haze over Zuba Town. The other mountains in and around it stay a considerable distance from it, which the Zuba people see as a form of respect being paid by the other mountains to Zuma Rock for its royal presence in the locality.

                     <p>
                        Visiting Zuma Rock between April and October, which marks the rainy season in central Nigeria where the rock is situated, would afford you the opportunity of seeing the much talked Zuma Rock Fire, as the apex of the Zuma Rock catches fire under heavy rainfall. Over time, this has remained one of the wonders of the Zuma Rock.

Aso Rock houses the three major seats of power of the Nigerian Federal Government namely; Presidential Villa (Aso Rock Villa), National Assembly, and the Supreme Court, albeit the Aso Rock Villa building is the only structure built in the valley of the Rock. Although tourists are still allowed to visit this place, due to the rise in the menace of terrorist attacks by Boko Haram in recent times, this access has become limited.
